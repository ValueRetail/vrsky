Use Limitation: 1 user

License Grant: Licensor hereby grants to each recipient of the Software
("you") a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free and fully-paid-up
license, under all of the Licensor's copyright and patent rights, to use,
copy, distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and display
the Software, subject to the Use Limitation and the conditions set forth
below.

Use Limitation: The license granted above allows use by up to the number of
users per individual or entity set forth above (the "Use Limitation"). For
determining the number of users, "you" includes all affiliates, meaning
legal entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with you.
If you exceed the Use Limitation, your use is subject to payment of
Licensor's then-current list price for licenses.

Service Provider Restriction: You may NOT use the Software to provide any
hosted, managed, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering to third parties,
whether for a fee or free of charge. This restriction applies to both free
and commercial license holders. You may only use the Software for your own
internal business operations. Specifically prohibited uses include but are
not limited to:

- Offering VRSky as a managed service to customers
- Providing integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) using VRSky
- Reselling access to VRSky infrastructure
- Operating a multi-tenant SaaS platform based on VRSky
- Any use where third parties directly interact with VRSky as a service

For service provider or SaaS licensing, contact Licensor separately.

Delayed Open Source Publication: On the second anniversary of each version's
initial release, or upon discontinuation of the product, whichever occurs
first, the Licensor will re-license that version under the Apache License 2.0
or another Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license. This ensures the
Software will eventually become Open Source Software, providing long-term
availability to the community while allowing the Licensor to maintain a
sustainable business model during active development.

of this license document to be provided in a reasonable manner. Any
redistribution of the Software is only allowed subject to this license.

Trademarks: This license does not grant you any right in the trademarks,

CONDITION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
SOFTWARE.

Termination: If you violate the terms of this license, your rights will
terminate automatically and will not be reinstated without the prior written
consent of Licensor. Any such termination will not affect the right of
others who may have received copies of the Software from you.
