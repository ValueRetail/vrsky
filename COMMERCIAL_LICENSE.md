## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a solo developer working on a commercial product. Do I need a license?
**A**: No, if you're the only user accessing VRSky, you can use the free version. Once you have a second team member who uses VRSky, you'll need a commercial license.

### Q: What counts as a "user"?
**A**: A user is any individual who accesses the VRSky platform, whether to create integrations, manage configurations, or monitor operations. Service accounts and API keys don't count as users.

### Q: Can I evaluate VRSky before purchasing?
**A**: Yes! The free version (1 user) is perfect for evaluation. You can test all features before deciding on a commercial license.

### Q: What if I'm a startup with limited budget?
**A**: We offer startup-friendly pricing for early-stage companies. Contact us to discuss options.

### Q: Can I contribute to VRSky even with the Fair Source license?
**A**: Yes! We welcome contributions. Contributors retain copyright to their contributions, which are licensed under the same Fair Source terms.

### Q: What happens if I exceed the 1-user limit without a license?
**A**: Your rights under the Fair Source License terminate automatically. Please contact us immediately to obtain a commercial license and avoid any compliance issues.

### Q: Is this "open source"?
**A**: VRSky is **source-available**, not traditional "open source" (OSI-approved). The source code is publicly available on GitHub, but commercial use has restrictions. This is sometimes called "fair-code" or "ethical source".

### Q: Can I fork VRSky?
**A**: Yes, you can fork and modify VRSky, but any redistribution must include the same Fair Source License. If your use exceeds 1 user commercially, you still need a commercial license.

### Q: Do I need a license for development/staging environments?
**A**: If you have 2+ people accessing development or staging environments for a commercial purpose, yes. For pure testing with 1 developer, no license is needed.
