## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a solo developer working on a commercial product. Do I need a license?

**A**: No, if you're the only user accessing VRSky **for internal use**, you can use the free version. Once you have a second team member who uses VRSky, you'll need a commercial license. Remember: you cannot offer VRSky as a service to your customers under any license type without a Service Provider License.

### Q: What counts as a "user"?

**A**: A user is any individual who accesses the VRSky platform, whether to create integrations, manage configurations, or monitor operations. Service accounts and API keys don't count as users.

### Q: Can I use VRSky to provide integration services to my customers?

**A**: **No**, neither free nor commercial licenses permit offering VRSky as a service. Standard licenses are for **internal use only**. If you want to build a service offering around VRSky (managed hosting, iPaaS, etc.), you need a **Service Provider License** - contact sales@valueretail.com.

### Q: What's the difference between "internal use" and "service provider use"?

**A**:

- **Internal Use (Allowed)**: Your company uses VRSky to integrate your own systems, automate your own workflows, connect your internal applications.
- **Service Provider Use (Prohibited without special license)**: You offer VRSky access to customers, run VRSky as a hosted service, provide iPaaS using VRSky, charge customers for VRSky-based integrations.

### Q: Can I evaluate VRSky before purchasing?

**A**: Yes! The free version (1 user) is perfect for evaluation. You can test all features before deciding on a commercial license.

### Q: What if I'm a startup with limited budget?

**A**: We offer startup-friendly pricing for early-stage companies. Contact us to discuss options.

### Q: Can I contribute to VRSky even with the Fair Source license?

**A**: Yes! We welcome contributions. Contributors retain copyright to their contributions, which are licensed under the same Fair Source terms.

### Q: What happens if I exceed the 1-user limit without a license?

**A**: Your rights under the Fair Source License terminate automatically. Please contact us immediately to obtain a commercial license and avoid any compliance issues.

### Q: Is this "open source"?

**A**: VRSky is **source-available** Fair Source Software, not traditional "open source" (OSI-approved). The source code is publicly available on GitHub, but commercial use has restrictions to protect our business model. However, each version will automatically become Open Source (Apache 2.0) **two years after its release** or if the product is discontinued. This ensures long-term availability while supporting sustainable development.

### Q: What happens to old versions of VRSky?

**A**: VRSky follows **Delayed Open Source Publication (DOSP)**. Each version becomes Open Source under the Apache License 2.0 two years after its initial release. For example, VRSky v1.0 released in 2026 will become Apache 2.0 licensed in 2028. This is a core principle of Fair Source Software.

### Q: Can I fork VRSky?

**A**: Yes, you can fork and modify VRSky, but any redistribution must include the same Fair Source License. If your use exceeds 1 user commercially, you still need a commercial license.

### Q: Do I need a license for development/staging environments?

**A**: If you have 2+ people accessing development or staging environments for a commercial purpose, yes. For pure testing with 1 developer, no license is needed.
